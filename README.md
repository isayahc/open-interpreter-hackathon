# open-interpreter-hackathon

# problem statement
- It is well known that Agents are able to use tools, however often time these tools are written by humans
- Writing and rewriting scripts to accomplish to solve frequencly asked questions is wasteful to resources
- Typically code generated by LLMs are machine agnostic, causing issues when copying and running

# Solution
- Due to open-interpreter's ability to write and save code, toolkits can now be expanded with minimal human labor
- Tools are also able to be expanded upon when needed
- Tools are made individually for each machine, and code will be written for that machine

# Example
